          Full payment for the agreed-upon carriage service is required upfront before the shipment

          The Company will not transport goods that are illegal, dangerous, or otherwise prohibited 
          under the laws and regulations of the Federal Republic of Nigeria <strong> (FRN) </strong>or any transit country. 
          The Customer is solely responsible for ensuring the legality of all items. If Prohibited Goods 
          are shipped and result in seizure, confiscation, fines, or legal action, the Customer will bear

          and fees, and obtaining necessary permits or licenses from Nigerian regulatory authorities. 
          The Company acts solely as a carrier and is not liable for delays or costs arising from 
          non-compliance with these requirements.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>b. Insurance Coverage:</strong> For goods exceeding the standard liability limit,

          acceptance.
